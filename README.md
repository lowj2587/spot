# Hi, I built this myself!

As a personal project, i decide to make my playlist into a website.
this only uses `index.html`.
More scripts like java, CSS, and others can be used by double right clicking the title of the script

To change the script style, name it to what you would like to use.
common ones include -

← `index.html`:The main HTML file, typically the entry point for web applications.

← `style.css`: The main stylesheet for styling the HTML content.

← `script.js`: The main JavaScript file for adding interactivity.

← `package.json`:Used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies and scripts.
